<h3>Ray-Finned Fish</h3>
<p>They have a bony endoskeleton and a swim bladder. Their thin fins consist of webs of skin over flexible bony rays, or spines.<br> The fins lack muscle, so their movements are controlled by muscles in the body wall.<br> You can compare their ray fins with the fleshy fins of lobe-finned fish.</p>

<h3>Cartilaginous fish</h3>
<p>These fish have a complete backbone. They also have a relatively large brain.<br> They can solve problems and interact with other members of their species.<br> They are generally predators with keen senses. Cartilaginous fish lack a swim bladder.<br> Instead, they stay afloat by using a pair of muscular fins to push down against the water and create lift.</p>
